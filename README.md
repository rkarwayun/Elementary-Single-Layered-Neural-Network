# Single-Layered-Neural-Network
A basic single layered - single neuron neural network.

Implementation of a simple Single Layered Single Neuron Neural Network as explained in [this video](https://youtu.be/p69khggr1Jo).
After learning for about 10,000 iterations, a graph is plotted showing mean error over all the iterations.
